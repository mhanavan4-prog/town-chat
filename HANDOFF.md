# Thornreach — Session Handoff / Context

**Read this first if you're a Claude session picking up this project.** It records what's been
built, the current state of the code, how to get running in the sandbox, and where the traps are.
Each session starts with no memory, so this file is the memory.

Owner: Michael (mhanavan4). Repo: `github.com/mhanavan4-prog/town-chat`, branch `main`.
Local path on his Mac: `~/Desktop/town-chat` (connect this folder via the desktop app).

---

## What the project is

**Town Chat / "Thornreach"** — a 3D multiplayer browser town (Node + Express + `ws` +
Three.js). Everyone walks around as a humanoid; each building is its own chatroom. There are five
playable **classes** (Witch, Werewolf, Mystic, Knight, Wanderer), each with a 12–15 ability kit and
a six-chapter story campaign, plus a Wilds zone, night mobs, a bank + auction economy, a Stripe
"Town Pass" paywall, an arcade with mini-games, and a fully separate mobile (touch) build.

- `server.js` (~6.8k lines) — authoritative game server, WebSocket handlers, all game logic.
- `public/client.js` (~15k lines) — the whole client: Three.js rendering, movement, UI, WS.
- `public/index.html` — join screen, HUD, all modal markup + CSS.
- `test/*.test.js` — `npm test` (node:test, mock sockets). `test/audit-playthrough.cjs` is a
  full completability audit (not part of `npm test`; run it manually).

Design notes baked into the codebase: **no movement anti-cheat by design** (client-trusted movement,
self-enforced speed effects); **no database** — state is flat gitignored JSON files
(`accounts.json`, `bankAccounts.json`, `playerProgress.json`, `inventories.json`, etc.); the campaign's
**~2-hour pacing is intentional and enforced by a test** in `newfeatures.test.js` (don't "fix" it by
boosting chapter/quest XP — that breaks the pacing test on purpose).

---

## What's been done (chronological)

### Session A — full playthrough & review
Played all 5 characters through their campaigns + the world/economy/pass/PvP/mobile via a headless
Playwright harness driving the real client. Produced a pros/cons review. **Two real bugs found & fixed:**

1. **Invisible bench/barrel colliders** (user-reported "invisible object near Torchkeeper Cora"). Cause:
   `client.js` declared `makeBench` and `makeBarrel` **twice each** (outdoor props + interior versions);
   JS keeps the later declaration, so outdoor benches/barrels rendered at NaN coords — invisible but
   still colliding. Fix: renamed the outdoor builders to `makeBenchProp` / `makeBarrelProp` and pointed
   `PROP_BUILDERS` at them. (There are no other duplicate-declaration shadows — I swept for them.)
2. **Stored XSS in party chat.** Room chat escaped `< >` via `sanitizeText`, but the `party_chat` path
   did not, and the client rendered party messages with `innerHTML` → a party member could run JS in
   another member's browser (account-token theft). Fix: server now runs party text through
   `sanitizeText`; client `appendPartyChatLine` renders with `textContent`/`createElement`, never innerHTML.

Deliverables from that session (downloaded by the user, not in repo):
the playthrough pros/cons review (delivered in Session A, before the app was renamed to Thornreach).

### Session B — skill system, stats panel, and fixes for every review con
Built the class skill system + a character stats panel + gave equipment real stats, then fixed every
con from the review. **All shipped and tested.** Deliverable: `Skill-System-and-Con-Fixes.md`.

---

## The systems added in Session B (architecture)

### Class skill trees  (server.js + client.js + index.html)
- **Data:** `SKILL_CATALOG` (server.js) — 5 classes × 6 skills; each skill `{id,name,icon,desc,effect}`.
  `SKILL_MAX_RANK = 3`. Per-rank magnitudes in `SKILL_STAT_PER_RANK`. Effects: `power` (dmg),
  `guard` (defense), `vitality` (max HP), `haste` (cooldowns), `swift` (speed), `leech` (lifesteal),
  `mending` (out-of-combat regen, skill-only), `forage` (harvest yield), `sage`→`xp`.
- **Storage:** `prog.skills[charId] = { skillId: rank }` in `playerProgress.json`. The point pool
  (`prog.skillPoints`) is account-wide (shared across classes), allocations are per-class.
- **Handlers:** `skill_state` (request), `skill_allocate` (spend 1, validated by charId), `skill_respec`
  (refund the class's points). `skillStatePayload()` sends the tree + points + `statBlock`.
- **Client UI:** `#skillsModal` + `#skillsBtn` (HUD), `K` key, mobile `#menuSkills`. `renderSkills()`.
  `mySkillState`, `mySkillSpeedMult` (movement reads this — the one client-applied effect).

### Equipment stats + character stats panel (the "see my stats / preview swaps" feature)
- Equipment was **purely cosmetic** before. Now `EQUIP_STATS` (server.js) gives every equippable item
  real stat contributions in the SAME vocabulary as skills. Campaign relics are top-tier per slot.
- **Combined getter:** `statContrib(player, key) = skillStatContrib + gearStatContrib`. Every effect
  getter (`outgoingDamageMult`, `incomingDamageMult`, `playerMaxHealth`, `abilityCooldownFor`,
  `skillLifestealFrac`, `skillXpMult`, `skillSpeedMult`, `skillHarvestExtraChance`) reads it.
- **Hooks (where effects actually bite):** damage → `applyDamage` (covers melee + all abilities);
  defense → `absorbIncomingDamage` (PvP + mobs); max HP → all 6 `Math.min(100,…)` health caps were
  changed to `Math.min(playerMaxHealth(p),…)`; cooldowns → both cast handlers; XP → `grantXP`;
  harvest → the `harvest` handler; lifesteal → `applySkillLifesteal` in `applyDamage`; speed → client
  movement loop; regen → `tickPlayerStatusHealth`.
- **`computeStatBlock(player, equipOverride?)`** returns the skill-vs-gear split + finals, and can
  preview a hypothetical swap without mutating the player. Sent in `skill_state.statBlock`; the
  `equipStats` catalog is sent once in `init` so the client previews swaps locally.
- **Client UI:** `#invTabStats` (📊 Stats tab in inventory) → `renderStats()`; equip preview in the
  item action panel → `renderEquipPreview()`. HUD heart shows `hp/maxHp` when maxHP > 100.

### Con fixes (Session B)
- **#4 grind (intentional!):** added **Rested XP** — `REST_MS` 10 min/session at `REST_XP_MULT` 1.5,
  gated by `REST_COOLDOWN_MS` 2h per account (`prog.lastRestedAt`). Does NOT touch campaign/quest XP,
  so the pacing test still passes. Client shows a `#xpStripRested` countdown.
- **#5 pass timer "23h 60m":** `passTimeLeftLabel()` now floors minutes instead of rounding.
- **#6 anti-cheat (targeted):** `ABILITY_MAX_RANGE = 900` passed to `applyDamage` in both ability
  damage branches (was unranged → cross-map sniping); `bank_open` now requires `player.room === 'bank'`.
  (Full movement anti-cheat intentionally NOT added — contradicts the design.)
- **#7 persistence/auth:** `atomicWriteJson()` (temp-file + rename) for all 8 JSON stores;
  login/registration rate-limit `LOGIN_FAIL_LIMIT` 8 / `LOGIN_FAIL_WINDOW_MS` 5 min per IP.
- **#8 onboarding:** first-run `#welcomeModal` (4-step throughline), `tc_welcome_seen` in localStorage,
  hands off to the existing controls modal.
- **#9 Twilio:** corrected the Text-tab credential note (`#twilioTrustNote`) to say creds pass through
  the game server and to recommend a scoped API Key. Server never logs credentials (verified).

---

## Current state / what's on disk

**Modified & delivered to the Mac (all committed-ready):** `server.js`, `public/client.js`,
`public/index.html`, `test/newfeatures.test.js` (2 assertions updated with comments because they
assumed the old "equipment is cosmetic" contract).

**Testing status (all green):** `npm test` 7/7 · `node test/audit-playthrough.cjs` 213/213 ·
skill server test 36/36 · skill UI 60/60 · stats UI 10/10.

**To apply the build:** restart the server (`server.js`) + refresh the browser (client/html).

**Git:** on `main`, remote `origin`. `.env` is gitignored (holds a real `sk_test_` Stripe key — never
commit it). `.env.example` is tracked and currently clean. As of last check there was also an
untracked `test/resume.test.js` (a legit live-resume test).

---

## Getting running in a fresh sandbox (this took real effort — read before redoing)

The Anthropic sandbox **blocks the npm registry** (`registry.npmjs.org` → 403 "host not in allowlist"),
so `npm install` fails. Workarounds used:

1. **node_modules:** the deps (`express`, `ws`, `dotenv`, `stripe` + transitive) were tarred from the
   user's machine (`device_bash` → `tar czf`), staged in, and extracted. Easiest path in a new
   session: stage `node_modules` from the user's `~/Desktop/town-chat/node_modules` via the device
   bridge, or ask them to run `npm install` locally and stage the result.
2. **Three.js:** `public/three.min.js` (r128) is the CDN fallback the client needs when offline. Get it
   via `git clone --depth 1 --branch r128 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js`
   then `git sparse-checkout set build` → copy `build/three.min.js` into `public/`. (GitHub IS reachable
   through the git proxy; the npm registry and generic CDNs are not.)
3. Then `node server.js` runs. `npm test` works without three.js (mock sockets).

## The QA harness (ephemeral — lived in the cloud `~/harness`, not in the repo)

I drove the real client headlessly with Playwright (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`) against the running
server. If you need it again, rebuild these:
- **`qa-server.cjs`** — wraps `server.js` with a mutable day/night clock and an HTTP **side channel on
  :3999**: `/shift-to?min=`, `/offset`, `/grant-xp?name=&xp=`, `/heal?name=`, `/state?name=`, `/mobs`,
  `/night`. (Supports `GAME_PORT`/`SIDE_PORT` env for a 2nd isolated instance.)
- **`lib.cjs`** — `newPlayer()` helper: launches a context, joins (guest or account), dismisses the
  welcome+controls modals, exposes `td()`/`send()`/`go()`/`shot()`/etc. Reads `GAME_PORT`/`SIDE_PORT`.
- The client exposes a test hook at **`?testdrive=1`** → `window.__testDrive` (teleport, me(), send(),
  interiorKiosks(), etc.). Only present with that query param.
- Test scripts written: `play-class.cjs` (full campaign per class), `skills-ui.cjs`, `stats-ui.cjs`,
  `skills-server.test.cjs`, `social.cjs`, `economy.cjs`/`economy2.cjs`, `auction-ws.cjs`, `passflow.cjs`
  (needs `test/stripe-mock-server.cjs` on :3001), `mobile.cjs`, `portraits.cjs`, `xss-probe.cjs`.

**Gotcha:** background `node server.js` sometimes needs the harness's own background-task mechanism to
stay alive; a fresh `?testdrive=1` context has no localStorage, so the first-run welcome modal now
appears and must be dismissed (the `newPlayer` helper already does this).

---

## Caveats & things NOT done (candidate next steps)

- Campaign pacing is deliberately ~2h (test-enforced). If the user wants it shorter, that means
  lowering the level gates / `XP_THRESHOLDS` AND updating the pacing test — a real design change, ask first.
- Persistence is still flat JSON — fine on a real VM, lost on an ephemeral host redeploy (Render free
  tier). A real DB is the long-term fix; not done.
- Anti-cheat is intentionally partial (economy + ability range only); movement stays client-trusted.
- The live Stripe redirect can't be exercised in-sandbox (no outbound to Stripe); it's covered against a
  mock (`test/stripe-mock-server.cjs` + `test/qa-pass-flow.cjs`).
- Skill/stat balance numbers (8% dmg/rank, +12 HP/rank, gear values in `EQUIP_STATS`) are a first pass —
  easy to retune in one place if playtesting says so.

## Session C — App Store / Play Store packaging

Packaged the game for the iOS and Android stores as **Capacitor** wrappers (two Desktop folders:
`town-chat-ios`, `town-chat-android`), while the `town-chat` web build keeps Stripe for PC. All three
clients connect to ONE shared server (multiplayer = one town).

**Server changes (in town-chat/server.js — shared backend for all clients):**
- `/api/verify-iap` endpoint — validates an Apple StoreKit receipt (legacy verifyReceipt, prod→sandbox
  fallback) or Google Play purchase token (service-account JWT signed with built-in `crypto` →
  Play Developer API), then grants the SAME pass as Stripe via `grantForSession`. **Built-ins only,
  no new npm deps.** Config env: `APPLE_IAP_SHARED_SECRET`, `APPLE_BUNDLE_ID`, `GOOGLE_PLAY_PACKAGE`,
  `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`, `IAP_PRODUCT_ID` (default `town_pass_24h`).
- **CORS** on `/api/*` (mobile apps call cross-origin from capacitor://localhost).
- **`DATA_DIR`** env — the 8 JSON stores now live under `process.env.DATA_DIR || __dirname` so a host
  can mount a persistent volume (e.g. `/data`). Default unchanged for local/PC.
- Deploy config added: `Dockerfile`, `fly.toml`, `.dockerignore`, `DEPLOY-SERVER.md` (recommends
  Fly.io / Railway / VPS; NOT serverless or Render-free — needs persistent WS + disk).

**Mobile client (each app's www/ = copy of public/ with 3 diffs — PC public/ untouched):**
- `client.js`: added `SERVER_ORIGIN`/`apiUrl()`/`wsUrl()` (points WS + all `/api` fetches at
  `window.TOWNCHAT_SERVER` from config.js; empty = same-origin for web), and an IAP hook at the top of
  `startPassCheckout()` (`window.TOWNCHAT_IAP.buyPass` overrides Stripe when present).
- `index.html`: loads local `three.min.js` first (offline), then `config.js` + `mobile-payments.js`.
- `config.js` (per platform): sets `TOWNCHAT_SERVER`, `TOWNCHAT_PLATFORM`, `TOWNCHAT_IAP_PRODUCT`,
  (android) `TOWNCHAT_ANDROID_PKG`. **User must fill in TOWNCHAT_SERVER after deploying.**
- `mobile-payments.js`: cordova-plugin-purchase (CdvPurchase v13) → StoreKit/Play Billing → posts
  receipt/token to `/api/verify-iap`. Requires the player to be logged into a game account (pass
  follows the account). ⚠️ receipt-field extraction is the one thing untestable off-device.
- Each folder also has: `capacitor.config.json` (appId `com.thornreach.game`), `package.json`,
  `resources/` (witchy pentacle icon 1024 + splash 2732, generated from `mobile/assets/witch-*.svg` via sharp),
  `BUILD-IOS.md`/`BUILD-ANDROID.md`, `STORE-LISTING.md`, `PRIVACY-POLICY.md`, `README.md`.

**Verified:** the mobile www renders + joins over a cross-origin WebSocket + the IAP hook fires
(headless smoke test). NOT verified (impossible from here): native compile, signing, real IAP.
The native `ios/`/`android/` folders are generated on the user's Mac via `npx cap add`.

**If regenerating the mobile builds:** the icon/splash SVGs + rasterizer are in `~/mobile/assets`
(cloud, ephemeral); the 3 client diffs are described above.

## Session D (2026-07-11) — Desktop app (installable Mac/Windows/Linux game)

Built **`town-chat-desktop`** (delivered as a zip; unzip to Desktop alongside `town-chat-ios`/`-android`):
an **online-only Electron wrapper** — a hardened shell that connects to the deployed shared server, so
desktop players are in the SAME town as web/mobile. **No game code is bundled**: the window loads the live
client from the server, so redeploying the server updates every installed desktop player automatically.
The app only needs rebuilding for shell changes (launcher/icon/window behavior).

- `main.js` — launcher window (has the preload API) + game window (sandboxed, NO preload/Node;
  `window.open` → system browser; camera/fullscreen/pointerLock permitted for the selfie shop etc.).
  Auto-connects straight into town when a server address is known (baked `DEFAULT_SERVER_URL` or one the
  player saved); **Cmd/Ctrl+L** returns to the launcher to change servers. Stripe checkout is untouched —
  same in-window redirect on the server's own origin as a browser tab.
- `launcher.html` — one-card launcher (enter/remember the town address), styled to the game palette
  (forest bg, #9ee37d→#5ee7c0→#7ad9ff gradient), pentacle sigil.
- `package.json` — electron ^41 + electron-builder ^26 (versions verified current July 2026). Targets:
  mac dmg **universal** (unsigned, `identity: null`), win **nsis x64**, linux **AppImage x64**.
  appId `com.thornreach.game` (matches mobile). Icon `build/icon.png` = generated 1024px mint pentacle.
- `BUILD-DESKTOP.md` — exact Mac commands (`npm install`, `npm run dist:mac|win|linux`), Gatekeeper/
  SmartScreen notes for unsigned builds, and the proper signing/notarization path for later.
- **Verified in-sandbox:** launcher renders clean under Playwright (no JS errors, empty-URL guard, IPC
  wiring via stub). Electron itself can't run here (npm registry blocked) — `npm start` on the Mac is the
  real first run. Also verified along the way: the client's local `three.min.js` fallback works offline
  (r128 fetched via git sparse checkout; a copy exists only in the cloud sandbox, NOT added to the repo).

Decisions this session:
- **Online-only at Michael's request** (mid-session change): a full "Host a local town" mode — bundled
  `server.js` forked via Electron `utilityProcess` + an env-gated `FREE_TOWN_PASS` flag in server.js
  (single choke point `hasTownPass()`, plus `lockedRooms: []` in `/api/config` + init) — was built AND
  smoke-tested (10/10, boot + guest join + unlocked rooms), then **removed**: he doesn't want localhost
  towns with free passes. **`server.js` on the Mac was NOT modified this session** (the flag existed only
  in the sandbox copy). If local/LAN hosting is ever wanted again, this design works and npm test stayed
  7/7 with it.
- **Server status is unconfirmed:** Michael believes the deployed server is his **Render** site (URL not
  yet provided; check his browser history for `….onrender.com`). `fly.toml` still has the placeholder app
  name, so Fly was likely never used. ⚠️ DEPLOY-SERVER.md warns Render's FREE tier cold-starts and loses
  the flat-JSON saves on redeploy — worth confirming his plan and migrating per DEPLOY-SERVER.md if it's
  free tier. `DEFAULT_SERVER_URL` in `main.js` is `''` — bake his URL in when known (players can also type
  it once in the launcher; it's remembered).
- Housekeeping: `_to_delete/node_modules.tgz` in the town-chat folder is a leftover transfer tarball from
  this session (device_bash can't delete files) — safe to trash with the rest of `_to_delete/`.

### Session D, later — witchy join-screen redesign + passcode field removal

`public/index.html` + `public/client.js` updated (**web build only** — the mobile apps' `www/` copies
still carry the OLD join screen; re-sync those two files next time the apps are rebuilt).

- New Thornreach front door: opaque night scene behind the card (`#jsNight`: vw/vh box-shadow
  starfields, waning-crescent moon, drifting fog blobs, rising embers, pine-silhouette SVG), violet
  card with pentacle sigil, class names under the five `charOption` talismans, button text
  "ENTER THE TOWN", `<title>` renamed Town Chat → Thornreach. Title font is *Cinzel Decorative* via a
  Google Fonts `<link>` with Georgia/serif fallback (the sandbox blocks the font CDN, so sandbox
  screenshots show the fallback — the live site gets the engraved face).
- **All element ids kept** (`nameInput`/`joinBtn`/`.charOption[data-char]`/tabs/account fields) — the
  QA-harness contract is intact, and `showResumeUi` still finds `.card`. New CSS is strictly scoped
  under `#joinScreen` (plus `#jsNight` + `js*` keyframes), inserted right after the `.charOption`
  rules; the shared `.overlay/.card/.title/.btn` used by in-game modals are untouched. A
  `prefers-reduced-motion` block stops the ambience animations.
- **Passcode field is no longer always-visible** (this was the user request): `#passInput` now sits
  inside hidden `#passRow`. `client.js`'s `join_error` handler reveals the row when a server refuses
  with a /passcode/i message (i.e. `TOWN_PASSWORD` towns), swaps in a friendlier "This town is
  warded…" line, and focuses the input; retry with the right passcode then joins. Open towns never
  see the field. **Zero server changes.**
- Verified: Playwright 13/13 (open-town guest join with picked class, class-select toggle, account
  tab, 390px mobile fit, warded-town reveal → successful passcode join), `npm test` 7/7.
- Also renamed the two remaining player-visible old-name strings in `index.html`: the first-run
  welcome modal ("Welcome to Lanternside Bay" → "Welcome to Thornreach", subtitle now "edge of the
  Wilds") and the mobile ☰ menu header ("Town Chat" → "Thornreach"). Verified in a live join.
- Welcome modal step 2 is now platform-aware (same `MOBILE_UI` pattern as the controls modal):
  desktop says "press **F** at the townsfolk", touch says "walk up to a townsperson and **tap the
  glowing prompt that pops up**". Spans `#welcomeQuestDesktop`/`#welcomeQuestMobile` toggled in
  `openWelcomeModal()` (client.js). Verified on both viewports.
- To see it live: restart the local server / redeploy (the deployed host serves `public/` as-is).

### Session D, later still — 3× Wilds mobs + returning-player character select

**`server.js` changed for the first time this session** (plus `public/index.html` + `public/client.js`;
mobile `www/` copies drift further — re-sync at next app rebuild). The FREE_TOWN_PASS prototype was
fully reverted from the working copy BEFORE these edits (verified byte-identical to the Mac's server.js
first), so the only server deltas are the two features below.

- **Wilds density:** `MOB2_SPAWNS` went 8 → 24 points (6 each of shade_stalker / bog_brute /
  night_howler / will_o_wisp) — the user found the 10k×10k Wilds "sparse at night". New points sit on
  the same 1000×1000 design grid (scaled by `WILDS_SCALE`), spread to corners/midfield, all clear of
  the portal landing at (500,880). Verified over the wire: `wildlife_state.mobs2.length === 24`.
  Note: `wildlife_state` broadcasts every 150ms to everyone, so +16 mobs ≈ +2KB/tick — fine at this
  scale. Respawn/aggro/loot all reuse the per-mob fields; no other logic touched.
- **Character roster ("continue as …"):** accounts now remember what they played.
  - Server: join handler records `prog.characters[charId] = {firstPlayedAt, lastPlayedAt}` +
    `prog.lastCharId` for account joins (guests untouched). New `POST /api/characters` {token} →
    {username, color, level, lastCharId, characters:[{charId, lastPlayedAt, chapter}]} sorted
    newest-first; stale token → 401 (sessions are in-memory and die on restart — the 401 makes the
    client fall back to the login form instead of silently guesting).
  - Client: `#charRoster` in the Account tab — witchy "continue as" cards (mini avatar, "Name the
    Class", shared account Level, per-class campaign Chapter, LAST PLAYED tag), auto-shown when a
    saved login exists (roster fetch on load / after login+register). Card click selects that class;
    "＋ New character" flips back to the classic picker (label swaps to "choose a calling for your new
    character"); logged-in state hides the username/password form (log out brings it back). Guests and
    characterless accounts see the classic picker unchanged. NOTE: level/XP/skill points are SHARED
    per account (per-class: campaign + skill allocations) — cards show the shared level by design.
  - Join payload/protocol unchanged — "continue" is just joining with that charId.
- Verified: Playwright 14/14 roster flows (fresh visit, register, play, re-login roster, last-played
  tag, continue-as rejoin, new-character toggle, saved-token auto-roster) + wire mob count 24 +
  `npm test` 7/7 + `audit-playthrough` completability clean.
- Sandbox gotcha for future sessions: `pkill -f "DATA_DIR=..."` never matches (env vars aren't in the
  cmdline) — kill test servers with `pkill -f "node server.js"`.

### Session D, final round — HUD: hint un-buried + desktop ☰ menu

`public/index.html` + `public/client.js` only (server untouched; mobile `www/` copies drift further).

- **"Press F" hint vs level bar (user-reported):** `#interactHint` sat at `bottom:96px`, `#xpStrip` at
  `bottom:90px` — same center column, same z-index, strip drew on top. Hint moved to `bottom:132px`
  (clears the ~30px strip; `cmPrompt` at 150px is z-30 and urgent, so its rare overlap wins by
  design). touchMode hint position (236px right-side) unaffected. Verified by bounding boxes at
  Ranger Mara's kiosk: hint 627–668, strip 684–710.
- **Desktop ☰ menu (user request — "like the phone version"):** the six left-HUD chips
  (Inventory/Spellbook/Attacks/Journal/Skills/Drive) are retired on ALL platforms (`#leftHudButtons`
  display:none; buttons stay in the DOM — reveal/badge logic still writes to them). New `#pcMenuBtn`
  ("☰ Menu", chip-styled, top:64 left:16, hidden in touchMode) opens the SAME `#menuSheet` as mobile.
  Sheet CSS is now shared: centered card on desktop, classic bottom sheet in touchMode
  (`body.touchMode #menuSheetCard` override); added `:hover` states for mouse. Esc closes the sheet
  (new first-priority branch in the global keydown modal chain — otherwise Esc would "leave
  building" through the open menu). Keyboard shortcuts (I/J/K/H/P…) unchanged.
- **Skills theme bug (user-reported):** `#skillsBtn` was never in the chip style selector group
  (Session B oversight) — added, with a gold border tint, though the chips are now hidden anyway.
- **Skill-point badge:** `updateSkillsBadge()` now mirrors the unspent count onto `#pcMenuBadge`
  (on the ☰ chip) and `#menuSkillsBadge` (on the sheet's 🌟 Skills row, both platforms).
- Verified: Playwright 19/19 (chip row gone, sheet opens/centers, menu→Skills/Inventory work, Esc
  closes sheet, hint/strip boxes disjoint, mobile sheet + ☰ unchanged and bottom-anchored, no JS
  errors both platforms) + `npm test` 7/7.
- Harness note: old QA scripts that clicked `#skillsBtn`/`#inventoryBtn` directly will need to go
  through the ☰ menu (`#pcMenuBtn` → `#menuSkills` etc.) or call the open functions.

## ⏱️ SESSION D WRAP-UP — PICK UP HERE
**Written Friday, July 10, 2026 at 11:37 PM EDT (2026-07-11 03:37 UTC), end of Session D.
Addendum 11:58 PM EDT — read the ⚠️ below FIRST.**

**⚠️ RESOLVED (Session E, ~12:15 AM):** the revert turned out to hit `public/index.html`,
`public/client.js`, and `HANDOFF.md` (all back to pre-Session-D bytes) while `server.js` survived —
consistent with a partial `git restore`/checkout or an editor stale-buffer save; exact cause unknown
(ask Michael what ran at ~11:56 PM if it happens again). All three were restored from the cloud
workspace copies and re-committed to the folder. Lesson recorded: `device_list_dir` byte sizes can
be STALE/wrong on this Mac (iCloud Desktop sync suspected) — always verify by staging content, never
trust listing sizes alone.

**Everything shipped this session, in order:** (1) `town-chat-desktop` — online-only Electron
installer project, delivered as a zip in the conversation (NOT in this repo; Michael unzips to
`~/Desktop/town-chat-desktop`, then `npm install` + `npm run dist:mac|win|linux` per its
BUILD-DESKTOP.md). (2) Witchy THORNREACH join screen + passcode field hidden unless the town is
warded. (3) Welcome modal + mobile menu renamed Lanternside Bay/Town Chat → Thornreach; welcome
step 2 platform-aware (mobile says "tap the glowing prompt"). (4) Wilds night mobs ×3 (8→24).
(5) Returning-player character select (roster cards via new `POST /api/characters` + `prog.characters`
/`prog.lastCharId`). (6) "Press F" hint un-buried from the XP strip; PC HUD chips replaced by the
mobile-style ☰ menu (`#pcMenuBtn` → shared `#menuSheet`); skills-button theme bug fixed. Full
details in the Session D sections above. All tested: latest `npm test` 7/7, audit-playthrough clean,
Playwright suites 13/13 + 14/14 + 19/19.

**State of the folder:** `server.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/client.js`, `HANDOFF.md` all
current on disk with everything above. Git: Michael was given `git add … && git commit && git push`
commands after each round — **next session, run `git status` first** to see what he actually pushed;
anything still dirty is safe to commit as one batch. Render auto-deploys from `main` (assumed).

**Open threads, highest value first:**
1. **Deployed-server URL still unknown.** Michael thinks it's his Render site; never provided the
   `….onrender.com` URL. When he supplies it: bake it into `town-chat-desktop/main.js` →
   `DEFAULT_SERVER_URL` (currently `''`, so the launcher asks). Also confirm his Render plan —
   free tier cold-starts and wipes the flat-JSON saves on redeploy (see DEPLOY-SERVER.md; Fly/Railway
   configs are ready in this folder if he wants to migrate).
2. **Desktop app first build** — needs him to unzip + `npm install` + `npm start` on his Mac; icon
   currently a generated pentacle; offer stands to reuse the exact mobile icon if he connects the
   `town-chat-ios` folder (`resources/icon-1024.png`).
3. **Mobile `www/` re-sync** — `town-chat-ios`/`town-chat-android` still carry the pre-Session-D
   client. At next app rebuild: copy `public/index.html` + `public/client.js` over each `www/`,
   re-apply the 3 mobile diffs (config.js + mobile-payments.js script tags, local three.min.js,
   `SERVER_ORIGIN` plumbing — see Session C notes), then `npx cap sync`.
4. **QA harness scripts** that clicked `#skillsBtn`/`#inventoryBtn` chips must now go through
   `#pcMenuBtn` → `#menuSkills`/`#menuInventory` (chips are display:none everywhere).
5. Housekeeping: `_to_delete/` (incl. the node_modules.tgz transfer tarball) is safe to trash.

**Sandbox recipe (worked all session):** npm registry blocked → stage `node_modules` via
`device_bash` tar into `_to_delete/` + `device_stage_files`; three.min.js r128 via sparse git clone
(github reachable); Playwright at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium` with
`NODE_PATH=/home/claude/.npm-global/lib/node_modules`; kill test servers with
`pkill -f "node server.js"` (env-var patterns never match); join-screen test hook: `?testdrive=1`.

## Session E (2026-07-11, ~12:00–12:45 AM EDT, same conversation) — the witchy round

`public/index.html` + `public/client.js` (server untouched; mobile `www/` drift grows). Also
re-delivered `thornreach-desktop.zip` (launcher star fix baked in).

1. **Revert recovery** — see the resolved ⚠️ in the wrap-up above.
2. **Perfect pentagram** (user request): the join-screen/launcher sigil's hand-plotted star path was
   lopsided (bottom legs pinched). Replaced with exact 72° geometry, tips on the r=44 ring:
   `M50 6 L75.86 85.6 L8.15 36.4 L91.85 36.4 L24.14 85.6 Z` (order 0→2→4→1→3). Playwright verifies
   all 5 vertices are within 0.004 of the ring. Desktop `build/icon.png` was already correct
   (generated with real trig) — only the two inline SVGs were wrong.
3. **Every interior is now witchy** (user request — "like the two paid buildings and the cave").
   All via the existing `INTERIOR_THEMES` override machinery + four NEW `lightsStyle`s in
   `getInteriorScene()`; every kiosk/NPC/seat keeps its exact position & id, dressing only:
   - **cafe → "The Cauldron Café"** — ember amber; `lantern` style (chained witch-lanterns);
     bubbling green cauldron by the bar, herb bundles on the beams, pumpkin stack, witchy paintings.
   - **library → "The Midnight Archive"** — violet/indigo; `candle` style (floating candle
     clusters); rune ring floor decal, four hovering books, crystal ball on the reading table.
   - **hall → "The Coven Court"** — crimson/gold; `brazier` style (iron tripod braziers); great
     pentacle floor inlay under the council table ringed by 13 candles (3 lit, as tradition demands).
   - **bank → "The Gilded Vault"** — gold/verdigris; `vaultlamp` style (gilded candelabras,
     pale-green flames); "The Auditor" raven on a marble perch; paintings retitled.
   Arcade/Parlor/cave untouched. Palette spread: cave purple · arcade starlight · parlor ghost-green
   · café ember · archive violet · court crimson · vault gold.
4. **Witchy daylight** (user request): `SKY_DAY` 0x8fd0ef → **0x9b93c9** (mauve), `AMBIENT_DAY` →
   0xe6dcf5, sun tinted amber (0xffe2b8). Trees darkened bluish-green with every ~5th a plum
   **thornwood** (deterministic from position — same forest for every client). Shrubs darkened.
   Six **fairy rings** of red-cap mushrooms added outdoors (client-only, walk-through, no
   colliders), the one at (2450, 820) fae-touched with a violet glow. Night palette untouched.
5. Verified: witchy suite 12/12 (pentagram radii, forced-day outdoor render, all four interiors
   entered + NPC hint proximity, zero JS errors) + `npm test` 7/7.
   **Testing gotchas learned:** indoor player coords are WORLD-anchored (building corner + local),
   NOT render-space — use `interiorKiosks()[].world` for teleports; the client day/night clock is
   plain `Date.now() % CYCLE_MS` (40-min cycle), so `addInitScript` shifting `Date.now` forces the
   phase for screenshots.

6. **Item audit (all 83 items)** — every ITEM_CATALOG + PLANT_CATALOG entry checked for unique
   icon / witchy description / theme fit (deliverable: `item-audit.md` in the chat). Fixed: 11 icon
   collisions (24 items) → all 83 icons unique (map in the report; both server & client catalogs
   changed in sync — a scripted checker verified ids/names/icons match and desc coverage is 100%);
   18 missing descs added; ~30 bland descs rewritten witchy; **bug: the five Wildlands quest-reward
   items (lumber_bundle/stone_block/iron_ingot/druid_stone/hollow_shard) existed only server-side —
   the client couldn't render them; now added client-side.** NO names/ids/stats/effects changed
   (quest text references names). Reported-not-changed misfits for Michael to decide: Hard Drive 💽
   (feature-wide rename candidate: "Whisper Box"), Wizard Hat (→ Crooked Hat?), the generic starter
   six, chalice/helm icon compromises, and a caution that some new icons are recent Unicode
   (🫙🩻🪢🦬🌠🥷) — verify on older phones.

7. **"Leave the town" (log out to start screen)** — new `#menuLogout` row in the shared ☰ sheet
   (both platforms). Two-tap confirm (arms for 3s, turns red "⚠️ Tap again to leave"), then clears
   `tc_live_resume`/`tc_resume` from sessionStorage (else the fresh page would silently resume
   straight back into town), closes the WS, and `location.reload()`s — the one guaranteed-clean way
   back to the join screen in a join-once-per-page client. `tc_account` survives, so returning
   players land on their character roster. Verified 8/8 (arm ≠ leave, leave lands on join screen, no
   auto-resume, stash cleared).
8. **Portal-plaza declutter (user report)** — `decor_46` (lamppost), `decor_57` (noticeboard) and
   `decor_58` (bench) sat stacked in a ~110-unit patch right behind the Wilds portal (1600,700).
   Spread in `WORLD.natureDecor` (server.js): lamppost → (1720,540), noticeboard → (1480,430) beside
   Town Hall's door, bench → (1795,760) rot −0.5 by the flower patch. All ≥200 from the portal;
   spots verified clear of other decor (≥90) by script. NOTE: `test/gen-scenery.cjs` regenerates
   this array — if it's ever re-run, re-apply these three positions (comment left in the array).

Open next: Michael's Render URL for the desktop app; mobile www re-sync; the git push of Sessions
D+E (one batch: `git add server.js public/index.html public/client.js HANDOFF.md`); his verdict on
the item-name misfits above.

---

## Session F (2026-07-11, morning) — THE FULL TIER-3 UPGRADE (KayKit assets + lighting overhaul)

The "tier 3" plan from a lost conversation turned out to be: **swap the procedural look for KayKit
asset packs** (Kay Lousberg, kaylousberg.com — the "cute" style Michael remembered; all CC0) plus a
full lighting/post-processing overhaul. Michael confirmed the KayKit lineup render before the swap.
Everything below is CLIENT-ONLY — `server.js` untouched this session.

### What shipped
1. **KayKit characters replace the procedural humanoids** (players AND town/wilds/interior NPCs):
   Witch→Mage, Werewolf→Barbarian, Mystic→Rogue_Hooded, Knight→Knight, Wanderer→Rogue
   (`public/kk/*.glb`, ~3.6MB each, fully rigged). Real skeletal animation via AnimationMixer:
   Idle / Walking_A / Running_A (speed-scaled), class-flavored attack one-shots mapped from the old
   `attackAnimType` contract ('slash'/'cast'/'punch' → KayKit clips in `kkAttackClip()`),
   Sit_Chair_Idle when seated, Sit_Floor_Idle for meditate, Death_A on death. NPC updaters drive
   Walking/Interact/Sit_Floor_Idle (torchkeepers pray). Static interior NPCs idle-breathe via the
   central `KK.tick()` (all mixers tick there; player visuals' mixers removed on destroy).
2. **KayKit buildings replace the six box shells** (`public/kk/bld/`, Medieval Hexagon Pack scaled
   up ~4x — looks great): cafe→tavern_red, library→church_blue, arcade→home_B_yellow,
   lounge→tower_A_green, hall→castle_red, bank→blacksmith_yellow. Collision unchanged (same
   footprint rects); model rotated so its baked door faces `getDoorSide(b)`; the old door SLAB is
   invisible on KayKit buildings (model has its own) but stays registered in `lockVisuals` so
   lock-state signs still work. Name/lock signs float above the model height (`userData.kkHeight`).
3. **KayKit props via PROP_BUILDERS** (same server decor positions & colliders): bench→
   bench_decorated, lamppost→post_lantern (LAMP_GLOWS contract preserved with two sprites),
   well→building_well_blue, fence→Halloween fence. Crate/barrel/haybale/stump/log/noticeboard/stall
   stay procedural.
4. **Set dressing (client-only, walk-through, fairy-ring precedent)**: jack-o'-lantern pairs at
   every building door, a fenced graveyard + crypt behind the Town Hall, a candle shrine at the
   fae-touched fairy ring; Wilds gets a crooked arch gate at the portal approach, 8 scattered dead
   trees, grave markers near the ritual circle (`kkTownDressing`/`kkWildsDressing`).
5. **GFX module (lighting/post/quality)** — the `GFX` IIFE near `initScene`:
   - PCFSoft shadow maps: the shared outdoor sun/moon cast (they migrate town↔wilds; `.target`s +
     sky group added to the swap lists); the shadow box follows the player (`GFX.beforeRender`);
     static scenes get a one-time fitted box. Meshes are auto-tagged per scene by an incremental
     children scan (transparent/additive/Basic materials and flat ground planes don't cast).
   - Post chain (medium/high): RenderPass → UnrealBloom (strength breathes 0.34→0.76 with night) →
     grade (saturation 1.07 + vignette) → FXAA. **Color pipeline stays LINEAR + NoToneMapping — the
     authored palette survives untouched** (ACES/sRGB was tried and washed everything; don't redo it).
   - Ambience: two twinkling star layers + drifting clouds + moon halo (one sky group riding the
     camera, migrates with the lights); firefly clusters (fairy rings/portal/plaza + 5 Wilds spots)
     fade in at night.
   - **Quality tiers** via ☰ menu row `#menuGraphics` ("✨ Graphics"): Auto(→High desktop / Medium
     touch) / Low / Medium / High, persisted `tc_gfx`, URL override `?gfx=low|medium|high|auto` for
     QA. Low = classic pipeline (no shadows/composer). Switching re-configures shadow maps + sweeps
     `material.needsUpdate`.
6. **Asset pipeline**: `KK` module (top of client.js) preloads everything from `/kk` at page load;
   the join button waits for it (max 12s, "Summoning…") then proceeds; **every KayKit piece falls
   back to the classic procedural builder if its file fails**, so a broken asset can never brick the
   town. `presetOverride` callers (Ember Wastes humanoid mobs) intentionally keep the classic builder.
7. **Equipment on KayKit rigs**: weapon/ring/boots parent to skeleton bones (`handslotr/l`,
   `footl/r`) via scale-compensating wrappers (`_equipParent`); equipping a weapon hides the class's
   embedded KayKit hand-prop (staff/sword/knife) and restores it on unequip; hats ride the `head`
   bone; the chest overlay is SKIPPED on KayKit models (looks wrong on chibi bodies — stats
   unaffected). Embedded prop meshes are curated per class in `KK.KEEP`.
8. New first-party files (all must be committed): `public/fx.js` (r128 post-processing bundle, MIT),
   `public/GLTFLoader.js`, `public/SkeletonUtils.js` (r128 examples), `public/three.min.js` (r128 —
   now self-hosted fallback actually exists in the repo), `public/kk/**` (~19MB, 40 files, CC0 —
   license headers in the packs; credit Kay Lousberg somewhere visible if you like, not mandatory).

### Verified (all in-sandbox, headless)
`npm test` 7/7 · `audit-playthrough` clean · zero page errors across: day/night town, night Wilds,
cafe interior, two players mutually visible with walk anims, mobile 390×844 touch UI (auto-Medium),
`?gfx=low`. Shadows/stars/fireflies/lamp glows confirmed in screenshots (delivered in chat).

### Known gaps / next session
- **Mobile `www/` re-sync is now REQUIRED before any app rebuild** — index.html/client.js changed
  AND the new files (fx.js, loaders, kk/) must be copied into both apps' `www/` (plus the 3 mobile
  diffs from Session C).
- Not visually spot-checked (code-only): death anim on a real kill, equip-attach look on live bones,
  interior kiosk NPC poses in every room. Cosmetic-only risk; check on the live site.
- Interiors have no shadow-casting light (ambient+points by design) — optional polish: one soft
  directional per interior.
- Plaza torch flames follow the SERVER clock, so forced-night client screenshots can show them
  unlit — not a bug.
- Headless FPS is SwiftShader (~4fps, meaningless). Real-GPU perf unmeasured; the scene is light,
  but if a weak laptop stutters, Low tier restores the old pipeline.
- The old `#skillsBtn` chips etc. remain hidden (Session D); harness `lib.cjs` gained a `gfx` opt.
- Sandbox gotchas added this session: the Bash tool's default 2-min timeout kills long Playwright
  runs (pass a longer tool timeout); `~` in the shell is /root while file tools write /home/claude
  (symlinked now); SwiftShader makes joins take 30-60s each.

### Session F, later — stair fix + self-aligning buildings + bank rebuild (user-reported)

Michael hit two things on the live build: players clipped through the KayKit buildings' entrance
stairs, and the bank (blacksmith model) "looks like an anvil, not a door". Fixes, all client-only:

- **Stair ramps:** `kkMeasureStairs()` raycasts each placed building model at build time and records
  the real stair height profile outside the door; the `outside` branch of `getFloorHeight()` now
  walks players AND NPCs up that profile (same mechanism as the Temple ramp). No colliders changed.
- **Self-aligning models (`kkAutoAlign`)**: the models' baked door faces vary per model (tavern's
  door faces +X natively, etc.). Instead of hand-tuned per-model rotations, each building now tries
  all four rotations at build time, raycasts for stoop/step mass at the game's door gap, keeps the
  best rotation, then slides the model along the wall so the detected steps center on the doorway.
  Verified: all six doors sit dead-center on their paths.
- **Bank model swap:** blacksmith → **gold church** (`building_church_yellow`) — big centered arched
  door + steps, reads "institution". The blacksmith files were dropped from `public/kk/bld/`
  (`git rm` any previously-committed `building_blacksmith_*` if git flags them); `building_church_yellow.*`
  added. If Michael ever prefers a commerce look, `building_market_yellow` (open stall front) was
  tested and works — one manifest line.
- Door-flanking pumpkins moved outward (off the stairs, beside them).
- Re-verified: `npm test` 7/7 · all six door approaches + bank walk-in · zero page errors.

### Session F, QA playthrough round — glitch hunt + tier-3 plants (user request)

Michael asked for a full playthrough hunting graphics glitches, plus "re-style the plants in the
tier-3 style". Scripted Playwright tours (day/night/dusk phases, all buildings in+out, Wilds,
plaza/temple/portal) found and fixed, all client-only:

- **Buildings now depth-fit their footprints** (`kkAutoAlign`): after the stair-detecting rotation
  pass, each model is measured along the door axis and shrunk until its depth truly fits (+52u rear
  lip max, width bulge ≤1.18×), then placed **flush to the door wall**. Before this, the castle
  overhung the portal plaza so far you could walk the camera inside it.
- **Graveyard relocated** to the wooded pocket EAST of the Town Hall (`hall.x+w+150, hall.y+60`).
  The hall backs onto the map's north edge, so "behind the hall" was half off-world and invisible.
- **Witch hat trimmed 0.8×** — the Mage_Hat brim filled the whole behind-the-shoulder camera.
- **Tier-3 plants** (all 17 PLANT_VISUALS species, town + Wilds): chunky KayKit-flavored rebuilds of
  all three shapes (fat spotted mushroom + skirt + baby sprout; curled-blade sprouts on a dirt
  mound; six-petal blooms with leaf pairs), deterministic per-position variation (no Math.random —
  same plant on every client), faint emissive on the magical species (`PLANT_GLOWY`) so they breathe
  with the night bloom. Harvested-look contract untouched (Lambert materials only).
- Verified again after fixes: `npm test` 7/7, zero page errors across every tour, all six door
  approaches, graveyard/castle/plants screenshots delivered in chat.
- **Non-bugs worth knowing** (investigated, left alone): mobs can land one last hit as you cross a
  door threshold (server sees the old outdoor position for a beat — cosmetic); town torch flames
  follow the SERVER clock, so client-forced-night screenshots show them unlit; the dark red
  "creatures" by day are giants_cap/toadstool plants; werewolf fur reads near-black at night by
  design of the night palette.

## Session G (2026-07-11, afternoon) — stair feel, crackling, Holly Wand, and 3 UI bug fixes

`public/client.js` + `server.js` changed. `index.html` untouched. All user-reported in one sitting:

### 1. Stairs finally feel right (user: "still very clunky")
Root causes found by raycasting height grids at every door (new `__testDrive.groundGrid`):
- kkAutoAlign's step-centering pass gated on a ROTATION-phase score measured while the model was
  still centered/recessed → read ~0 → centering silently skipped → tavern/arcade stoops sat ~50u
  off their doors, and the ramp zone lifted players onto AIR at the actual door line.
- kkMeasureStairs stopped at the first flat sample → the bank church's DETACHED porch (26u slab
  ~30u out, flat gap behind it) was never measured — players clipped straight through it.
- The zone applied the RAW step-function profile with a hard lateral cutoff, and player Y +
  camera lookAt snapped to it instantly per frame.

Fixes (all in client.js): per-rotation flush-to-wall before scoring + fresh post-flush centering
score (two passes); full-depth profile scan; monotone envelope (never sink into a step, porch
plateaus bridge to the wall); run-out extended so slope ≤ ~0.34 measured PAST the plateau;
connectivity-based lateral band width (detached side pillars can't inflate it) + smoothstep side
fades scaled by sill height; and a per-entity critically-damped floor-height chase (`v.floorYS`,
13/s, snaps on room change/teleport) used by body, ghost, labels, emotes, and the camera lookAt.
Town torch NPCs got the same chase (`v.baseYS`). Measured on live walks: max slope in/out ≈
0.25–0.33 (was: 18u pops over 2–3 frames), zero still-standing Y jumps.
Zones now: cafe sill 18/ramp 54 · arcade sill 33 (that model's real raised terrace)/102 · bank
26 plateau→78. Library/lounge/hall doors are genuinely flush — no zones, correct.

### 2. Graphics "crackling / seeing through things" (user report)
Two real causes, both fixed:
- **Shadow shimmer:** the player-following shadow box slid continuously → every shadow edge
  re-rasterized on a new texel grid each frame. beforeRender now TEXEL-SNAPS the anchor in the
  light's own plane (standard stabilization; verified: identical world-space quanta on 2u moves).
- **Camera inside geometry:** outdoors the chase camera freely entered building shells (backface
  culling = see-through walls popping) and tree canopies. Now: per-building blocker boxes
  (collision footprint × model height, `KK_CAM_BLOCKERS`) clip the camera's pull-back along the
  behind-the-player line — target AND eased position (hard clamp, so teleports can't glide it
  through walls; verified camera never inside any box across a 24-spot sweep) — while trees/tall
  dressing (`userData.camFade`, set in makeTree/kkPlace) GHOST to ~25% opacity when they stand
  between camera and player (clone-on-fade materials — KayKit shares materials across instances;
  restore guards against the harvested-look swap). NOTE: addNatureDecor used to OVERWRITE
  group.userData on harvestables — now merges (that wipe was untagging every tree).
- Also shipped: the `?gfx=low|medium|high|auto` URL override the Session F notes claimed existed
  but didn't — GFX reads it now (localStorage still wins otherwise).

### 3. Holly Wood → Holly Wand (user feature)
- Server: `wood` renamed **Holly Wood** (id unchanged — inventories/quests intact). Tree harvests
  toast progress: "(2/5) — collect 3 more and you can build a wand." / "(5) — enough to build a
  🎇 Holly Wand!". New `craft_wand` handler: 5 Holly Wood → `holly_wand` (weapon slot, EQUIP_STATS
  power 0.07/haste 0.04, icon 🎇 — uniqueness re-verified across both catalogs; excluded from the
  random-starter pool). Wood refunded if the pack can't fit the wand.
- Client: catalog entries + "🎇 Build Holly Wand (5 Holly Wood)" button on the Holly Wood action
  panel (disabled with an x/5 note until 5); `craft_result`/`craft_error` handlers; bespoke wand
  weapon mesh (crooked holly stick, mint band, lit tip + additive tip sprite); equipping adds a
  soft additive body AURA (any player, any room) and at NIGHT a real PointLight follows the bearer
  — fixed pool of 3 lights per outdoor scene (`wandLightPools`, constant count = no shader
  recompiles), assigned to nearest bearers in `updateWandLights()`, intensity 0 by day → ~1.25 at
  night. Verified end-to-end over the wire: 5 harvests (correct toasts) → craft → equip → aura
  0.18 day/0.34 night, light 0 day/1.12 night, screenshot clean.

### 4. Three UI bugs
- **Stuck item frame following clicks (user report):** inventory/bank/hotbar rerenders destroy a
  hovered cell → its mouseleave never fires → the tooltip stayed visible and rode the cursor
  forever. showItemTooltip/showActionTooltip now record the owner cell; the global mousemove
  hides the tooltip the moment the owner is detached or un-hovered. Verified: hover→rerender→move
  = hidden (was: stuck).
- **Chat picture → white page (user report, arcade):** room chat + spy-glass images called
  `window.open(dataURL)` which browsers block into a blank tab. Both now use the existing
  `openImageLightbox` (same fix the auction thumbs/notes already had). Verified in-page lightbox
  opens/closes, no window.open.
- (While there: `#unlockToast`-based toasts confirmed working for the new craft messages.)

### Testing status
`npm test` 7/7 · `audit-playthrough` clean ("No completability failures") · catalog sync check
(59 static ids match, icons unique) · live Playwright: stair walks (slopes above), 24-spot camera
sweep (never inside), tree-fade on/off, shadow-snap quanta, tooltip, lightbox, wand flow, mobile
390×844 join + ☰ menu smoke — all green, zero page errors in any run.

New `__testDrive` probes (testdrive=1 only): stairZones, floorH, visualY, camPose, camInfo,
doors, gfxInfo, groundGrid, lastToast, wandVisual, camBlockCheck, fadedCount, fadeListSize,
camDebug, segT, sunSnap.

### Notes / open threads for next session
- Sandbox gotchas: SwiftShader ~4fps at high quality means the render-loop dt CLAMPS at 0.05 —
  eased things (camera, fades) converge in GAME time, so waits in tests must be generous, or use
  `?gfx=low` (which now actually works). `device_bash` ~ is /root here, not /home/claude.
- The arcade model really does have a 33u raised terrace with side steps; the front approach
  glides up over its face. If Michael dislikes that, options: swap the model, or carve a lateral
  band that channels to the side steps.
- Standing ON a stoop and facing the wall clamps the camera very close (correct but tight —
  m floor 0.12). If it bothers anyone, raise the floor to ~0.2.
- Mobile `www/` re-sync (ios/android) still pending from Sessions D–F; this session widens the
  drift further (client.js + server.js).
- Git: Sessions D+E+F may still be unpushed — `git status` first; this session's batch is
  `git add server.js public/client.js HANDOFF.md`.

---

## Session H (2026-07-12, late night) — mobile apps REBUILT from scratch (Sessions C→G re-sync)

**Discovery:** `~/Desktop/town-chat-ios` and `-android` were EMPTY — Michael connected freshly
created folders; the Session C projects were never on disk (or were lost). So instead of the
planned www re-sync, both apps were rebuilt from scratch as complete **Capacitor 8** projects
(needs Node 22+, Xcode 26+ / Android Studio Otter 2025.2.1+; `cordova-plugin-purchase` ^13.15.4
— versions verified current July 2026). Extracted onto the Mac from tarballs via
`_to_delete/town-chat-{ios,android}.tgz` (safe to trash); 68 files each, md5-verified.

- **`www/` = `public/` current through Session G + the 3 mobile diffs, re-applied fresh:**
  1. `client.js` — `SERVER_ORIGIN`/`apiUrl()`/`wsUrl()` inserted INSIDE the IIFE right after
     `const proto = …` (~line 30; client.js is `(function(){"use strict";…})()` — the plumbing is
     scoped, NOT on window; `apiUrlMaybe` finds it via scope). Rewired: `setupWs` WebSocket,
     login/register, `/api/config`, `/api/checkout`, `/api/verify-session`, `/api/send-sms`
     (the Session D roster fetch already used `apiUrlMaybe`). IAP hook at top of
     `startPassCheckout()` → `window.TOWNCHAT_IAP.buyPass` when present.
  2. `index.html` — CDN three.js + fallback block replaced with plain local
     `<script src="three.min.js">`; `config.js` + `mobile-payments.js` tags added right before
     `client.js`.
  3. `config.js` per platform — **`TOWNCHAT_SERVER` is now BAKED IN = `https://town-chat.onrender.com`
     (Michael confirmed this session — the long-unknown Render URL!)**, `TOWNCHAT_PLATFORM`,
     `TOWNCHAT_IAP_PRODUCT` `town_pass_24h`; android adds `TOWNCHAT_ANDROID_PKG`
     `com.thornreach.game`. Plus `mobile-payments.js` (new implementation): CdvPurchase v13
     `store.validator` → `POST /api/verify-iap` `{platform, productId, receipt |
     purchaseToken+packageName, accountToken}` → approved→verify()→verified→finish(); requires a
     logged-in account (pass follows the account); cancel-quiet, replay-proof server-side.
- **Project scaffolding rebuilt:** `capacitor.config.json` (appId `com.thornreach.game`, appName
  Thornreach), per-platform `package.json`, `assets/` in the **@capacitor/assets layout**
  (icon-only/-foreground/-background 1024 + splash/splash-dark 2732 — pentacle regenerated with
  the Session E exact 72° geometry, mint→teal→ice on violet night), and rewritten docs:
  `BUILD-IOS.md`/`BUILD-ANDROID.md` (full path incl. store product setup + the Render env vars
  `APPLE_IAP_SHARED_SECRET`/`APPLE_BUNDLE_ID`/`GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`/`GOOGLE_PLAY_PACKAGE`),
  `STORE-LISTING.md`, `PRIVACY-POLICY.md` (needs a public URL before store submission), `README.md`.
- **Verified in-sandbox 12/12** (Playwright, mobile viewport, www served from :8080 vs game server
  on :3000 — the app's exact cross-origin shape, config.js route-intercepted to localhost): join
  screen renders; guest join over the CROSS-ORIGIN WebSocket; every client `/api` call hits the
  game origin, zero leak to the app origin; CORS; `/api/verify-iap` answers the contract
  (503 apple_iap_not_configured on junk receipt = wired, unconfigured); clicking the real
  `#unlockBtn` delegates to the IAP hook (no Stripe redirect); touchMode UI; 62 KayKit asset
  responses from the app bundle; zero page errors; in-town screenshot shows the full tier-3 look
  incl. platform-aware welcome copy ("tap the glowing prompt").
- **NOT verifiable in-sandbox (same as Session C):** native compile/signing, real StoreKit/Play
  purchases — the receipt-field extraction inside `store.validator` is the one off-device unknown
  (written defensively: android falls back to parsing `tx.receipt` JSON for the token).
- **Michael's remaining path (per BUILD docs):** `npm install` → `npx cap add ios|android` →
  `npx capacitor-assets generate` → `npx cap sync` → camera permission (Info.plist string /
  AndroidManifest `CAMERA`) → store products `town_pass_24h` + Render env vars → TestFlight /
  internal testing. Warn him about Render free-tier cold starts + save wipes before real launch.
- Server.js and web `public/` untouched. Git was clean & fully pushed through Session G at
  session start. Sandbox notes: `pkill -f "node server.js"` KILLS YOUR OWN SHELL (the pattern
  matches the command itself) — use `pkill -f "server[.]js"`; QA recipe = intercept `config.js`
  in Playwright to point `TOWNCHAT_SERVER` at localhost.

## Session I (2026-07-12, small hours, same conversation as H) — 💎 MOONSTONES, THE MIDNIGHT PEDDLER, and five fixes

The big monetization round: a premium currency + 100 legendary items + a weekly rotating shop +
a Moonstone auction lane, plus five user-reported fixes shipped along the way. `server.js`,
`public/client.js`, `public/index.html` all changed; mobile apps re-synced (both Desktop folders
current). **`npm test` 8/8 (new moonstones.test.js: 42 checks) · audit-playthrough clean ·
Playwright e2e 20/20 · zero page errors.** Michael must `git add server.js public/client.js
public/index.html test/moonstones.test.js test/stripe-mock-server.cjs HANDOFF.md && git commit &&
git push` so Render deploys — the new client REQUIRES the new server (init contract).

### 💎 Moonstones (premium currency)
- **Server:** `moonstones.json` in DATA_DIR `{balances:{accountKey:n}, grants:{grantId:…}}` via
  atomicWriteJson. Account-bound — guests can neither buy nor hold. `msBalance/msAdjust/
  grantMoonstones` (replay-proof: one grantId = one credit, retries echo balance). Packs:
  `MS_PACKS` ms_pack_small 200/$1.99 · medium 550/$4.99 · large 1200/$9.99.
- **Web purchases:** `/api/checkout` now takes `{product, account_token}` (default 'pass' —
  original flow untouched); MS sessions carry `metadata.ms_pack` and land on
  `/?ms_session={ID}` → **`/api/verify-ms-session`** (grant by the session's OWN metadata,
  requires account_token → 401 otherwise). Client stashes tc_resume exactly like the pass flow.
- **Mobile purchases:** `/api/verify-iap` now routes by productId — pass → pass grant; MS pack →
  `grantMoonstones(txId,…)` (accountToken REQUIRED → 400 account_required).
  `verifyAppleReceipt(receipt, productId)` filters by the requested product now.
  mobile-payments.js registers all 4 consumables and exposes **`buyProduct(productId, btn)`**
  (buyPass delegates). ⚠️ Michael must create the 3 new products in BOTH store consoles —
  BUILD-IOS/ANDROID.md updated with exact ids/names/prices.
- **WS:** init carries `moonstones`, `msPacks`, `msAuctionFee`, `legendaryCatalog`; pushes:
  `ms_state{balance}`; request: `ms_balance`; errors: `ms_error{message}`. After a checkout
  return the client re-asks `ms_balance` at 2.5s/6s — init snapshot vs verify grant vs push can
  interleave any way; the re-ask makes server truth final (race found in QA, fixed).
- **Client UI:** ☰ menu row "💎 Moonstones: N" → `#msModal` (3 pack cards; web→Stripe redirect,
  app→TOWNCHAT_IAP.buyProduct; login nudge otherwise). `refreshMsUI()` paints menu/modal/shop.

### 🌒 The Midnight Peddler (weekly legendary shop)
- **`LEGENDARY_CATALOG`** (server.js, ~line 1105): **100 hand-authored items** (20/slot ×
  weapon/head/chest/feet/ring; tiers 8/6/4/2 per slot priced 150/300/600/1200 💎 = CURIO/RELIC/
  ARCANUM/SEVERANCE-CLASS). Every item: witchy lore desc, unique emoji icon (validated against
  ALL existing icons), **stats capped at relic parity** (power≤.18 guard≤.12 vit≤20 haste≤.10
  swift≤.12 leech≤.06 xp≤.08 forage≤.15 — prestige, NOT pay-to-win; moonstones.test.js enforces
  the ceilings) and an **fx spec** `{c1,c2,prims[]}`. Generator + validators archived at
  `/root/gen_legendaries.py` in the Session I sandbox (not in repo; the literal in server.js is
  the source of truth now). Items merge into ITEM_CATALOG + EQUIP_STATS at boot; client receives
  the catalog IN INIT and merges (never hand-copy to client.js).
- **Rotation:** `legendaryWeeklySet(now)` — mulberry32 seeded by week index from
  `LEGENDARY_EPOCH` (Mon 2026-01-05 UTC; don't change it — reshuffles history), deterministic
  across restarts/clients, flips Mondays 00:00 UTC. 5 at a time; ~year covers >60 distinct.
- **Shop:** WS `legend_shop_open` → `legend_shop_state{items, nextRotationAt, balance,
  greeting}`; `legend_shop_buy{itemId}` validates weekly-set membership + balance + pack room
  (item → CARRIED inventory; stones burn). Client `#legendModal`: tier-colored rows, lore, "✦
  Everyone sees: …" fx line, stat line, countdown, ＋Get Moonstones. **The stall:** client-only
  dressing at `PEDDLER_SPOT (1350,1180)` (clear ground, verified) — violet canopy, cloaked
  figure, lantern glow, drifting motes; OUTDOOR_KIOSKS entry `npc:'legend'` → interact hint
  "browse the Peddler's wonders" (built in buildTownNPCs → buildMidnightPeddler).
- **Auction 💎 lane:** listings carry `currency:'gold'|'ms'` (old listings default gold).
  MS escrow/refunds hit moonstone balances (bank untouched); resolution pays seller
  `floor(bid*0.9)` — **AUCTION_MS_FEE 0.10 house cut** (deliberate sink), winner gets the item
  in bank slots as ever. Selfie/voice listings stay gold-only. Client: "Sell for" select +
  fee note; rows show 💎/🪙 by listing.

### ✨ LEGEND_FX (visible-to-everyone equipment effects)
- client.js module before EQUIP_ATTACH. 10 primitives: aura/orbit/runes/bubbles/wisps/embers/
  sigil/crown/trail/frost — additive sprites (shared canvas textures, ≤16/player, no per-frame
  allocs; sigil is a rotating ring mesh; runes are ᚠᚨᛉᛟᛞᛗ glyph sprites that "bubble off").
  Hooks: `LEGEND_FX.sync(v, equipped)` at the end of applyEquipVisual (keyed rebuild on equip
  change); `LEGEND_FX.tick(dt)` beside KK.tick in the render loop. GFX 'low' → first prim only.
  Verified live on TWO clients (fxInfo probe: `lg_banshee_garland` → 3 updaters, 9 sprites on
  the witness's view of the wearer). On real GPUs the bloom pass makes these pop far more than
  SwiftShader screenshots suggest.

### The five user-reported fixes (all verified in the 20/20 e2e)
1. **Torch/campfire healing stuck at 103/108** — `tickTorchHealing` gated on `health < 100`
   (pre-Session-B cap) while clamping to playerMaxHealth. Gate now uses playerMaxHealth. (Only
   stale 100-gate in the codebase — swept.)
2. **Raven's Cloak TypeError (v.torso.material)** — KayKit rigs expose `torso` as a positioning
   Group (no material), so EVERY status apply/clear crashed on KK visuals. Guarded both sites;
   colorcycle got a KK-safe hue-cycling aura sprite (classic rigs still tint the shirt).
3. **No collision in the Wilds** — TWO bugs: `addNatureDecor` pushed colliders into whatever
   `walls` pointed at (the TOWN array during wilds build — Wilds got nothing AND town got
   invisible colliders at overlapping coords); and the Wilds "forest" (addSpookyDecor) was
   `Math.random()` per client — every player saw a DIFFERENT forest, so it could never collide.
   Now: addNatureDecor takes an explicit wallsOut (wilds → WILDS_WALLS); addSpookyDecor is
   seeded-deterministic (same forest for everyone, spawn/campfire clearance zones) and
   registers ~293 colliders (trees r9, gravestones r6, ruins r16, campfire pits r14,
   waymarkers r9, werewolf tree r34, KK dead trees r11). Bone piles stay walk-through.
4. **Torchkeepers clipping temple pillars** — their dusk/dawn walks were straight-line lerps.
   `torchWalkPoint()` routes any platform-crossing walk through `TEMPLE_GATE` (north edge),
   constant speed, same fixed durations; segment-vs-AABB test leaves non-crossing walks direct.
   Unit-verified: closest pillar approach ≥36u from all sampled starts.
5. **"Town chat banner" never leaving (desktop report)** — `#roomTag` (the location pill) now
   fades (CSS .tagFaded) 5s after first join and after every room change; any change re-shows
   it. Plus the ask that came with it: ☰ menu already had 🎟️ Town Pass; added the 💎 row so
   both purchases work from anywhere (no walking back to town).

### QA seams added (testdrive=1 only)
`wallsCount()` (active/town/wilds collider counts), `applyStatus(type)` (direct status-visual
poke), `fxInfo()` (per-visual legendary fx: key/updaters/sprites). stripe-mock-server.cjs now
carries `metadata` through create/retrieve (needed by ms_pack sessions). QA scripts (sandbox,
not repo): qa_moonstones.cjs (20 checks), fx_showcase.cjs. Gotchas re-learned: `pkill -f` with
the plain process name in the SAME command string kills your own shell (use `[x]` brackets and
separate calls); on the device VM tar can't overwrite (no unlink) — extract to a scratch dir
under `_to_delete/` and `cp -Rf` over.

### State / next session
- **Mac is current:** town-chat (server.js, client.js, index.html, 2 test files, HANDOFF) +
  BOTH app folders (www re-synced via the fixed build script — it now preserves config.js +
  mobile-payments.js; BUILD/STORE docs list all 4 IAP products). `_to_delete/` gained the
  transfer tarballs + ios-x/android-x scratch dirs — all safe to trash.
- **Michael's queue:** (1) ~~git push~~ **DONE end of session** (after clearing a stale
  `.git/index.lock` — see gotcha below) — Render should be serving Session I;
  (2) create the 3 Moonstone products in App Store Connect + Play Console (BUILD docs);
  (3) `npx cap sync` + version bump + re-archive both apps whenever he next ships them;
  (4) his verdict on Peddler stall placement (1350,1180 — easy to move) and MS pricing
  (constants in one place: MS_PACKS + tier prices in the catalog).
- **Git-lock gotcha (bit us in G and I):** ANY git command run through device_bash leaves a
  stale `.git/index.lock` behind — the VM can refresh the index but can't unlink the lock, so
  Michael's next commit fails with "index.lock: File exists". Either avoid device_bash git
  entirely, or immediately `mv .git/index.lock _to_delete/git-index-lock-<session>` after
  (rename is allowed, delete isn't). Three such tombstones sit in `_to_delete/` already.
- **Balance levers** if playtesting demands: MS_PACKS, tier prices, AUCTION_MS_FEE, stat
  ceilings (regenerate catalog if changing), LEGENDARY_SET_SIZE / week length.
- Weekly-set determinism means the shop can be previewed for ANY date:
  `legendaryWeeklySet(Date.parse('2026-08-01'))` in a node REPL with the exports.

## Session J (2026-07-12, morning) — THE MOBILE UX OVERHAUL (clutter, panels, hotkeys, music)

`public/index.html` + `public/client.js` only (server.js untouched; `npm test` 8/8). Both app
folders' `www/` re-synced the same session (patch-based: diffed pristine public vs www to
recover the 3 mobile diffs, applied them onto the new files — `node --check` + a cross-origin
app-shell smoke 8/8 confirmed both diff sets landed). Verified: mobile e2e suite **69/69**,
desktop regression 13/13, zero page errors anywhere. All touch-scoped via `body.touchMode` —
desktop behavior is pixel-identical except where noted.

1. **One-thing-on-screen rule (the big clutter fix).** `watchOpenPanels()` (client.js, above
   buildMobileQuickSlots) observes the class attribute of every `.overlay`, the four
   floatPanels, `#inventoryPanel`, `#menuSheet`, `#chatPanel` → keeps `body.panelOpen` /
   `body.composeOpen` truthful no matter who opens/closes what. CSS under touchMode hides
   joystick/joyZone, actionCluster, xpStrip, interactHint, mobileTopBar, trackers, streakTag,
   partyHud while ANY panel is open (composeOpen keeps the top bar — 💬 is how chat closes;
   chat banners stay visible). The emote wheel now also sets `body.emoteWheelOpen` → hint/
   strip/joystick step back (cluster dim was already there). New modals inherit all of this
   free if they use class="overlay".
2. **Full-screen panel takeover (user request).** On touch, Inventory / Journal / Skills /
   Attacks / Spellbook / Loadout fill the screen (no floating mini-windows): sticky header
   with **‹ Menu** top-LEFT (returns to the ☰ sheet — injected by `mobileFullscreenPanels()`),
   sticky **Close at the BOTTOM** (Michael explicitly wants Close at the bottom, NOT top-right).
   Inventory got a new injected header + bottom Close (`#invMobHead`/`#invMobCloseBtn`; the old
   ✕ tab button is hidden on touch, still wired). `initDraggables()` skips touch entirely.
   Journal's duplicate inner story title is hidden on touch.
3. **z-order fix that matters everywhere:** `.floatPanel`/`#inventoryPanel` z 10/6 → **19** —
   action buttons (z 8/9) can never draw over an open panel, while overlay modals (z 20 —
   NOTE: `.overlay` is 20, only #menuSheet/#imageLightbox are 60) still paint above panels
   (loadout-over-attacks etc.). Don't raise panels ≥20.
4. **XP strip** no longer threads through the action wheel: on touch it docks top-left under
   the vitals pill (Lv label dropped — the pill already says it), bar 72px. unlockToast/
   announceBanner/chatNotifStack shift down ~32px to clear its lane.
5. **Hold-to-read ability peeks (user request).** `attachAbilityPeek(el, getInfo)` — press-and-
   hold ≥475ms (`ABILITY_PEEK_MS`) shows `#abilityPeek` (name / kind line / description /
   ready-or-recharging) until release; the release is SWALLOWED (touchend preventDefault + a
   one-shot 300ms capture-phase click guard) so a peek never casts; quick taps cast exactly as
   before. Wired: qs1-3 (re-tagged via `_peekAbilityId` on every rebuild), btnStrike, btnKit,
   btnCm, and every loadout slot/ability row. Works with mouse-hold on desktop too.
6. **Loadout editor redesigned on touch (user request — "confusing").** Three big labeled
   **WHEEL 1/2/3** cards (icon + ability NAME) up top, "Rest of your kit" as small numbered
   tiles, "All abilities" as icon+name ROWS with WHEEL badges; state-aware hint copy; the
   swap-place flow unchanged (`loadoutPlaceAbility`). Desktop keeps the classic 12-slot grid.
7. **Witchy music (user request — Music row did nothing).** The row used to proxy the cafe-only
   muteBtn. Now: `MUSIC_TRACKS` — four generative WebAudio recipes (🌙 Moonrise, 🔮 The Coven's
   Waltz, 🌲 Wilds at Dusk, 🎻 Ember Jig = the old tavern tune, quickened), all code, no audio
   files. ☰ row cycles Off → each track → Off (sheet stays open to listen; toast announces),
   persisted `tc_music`, first-gesture unlock for saved picks. The cafe's auto-tune still plays
   for players with no pick (`startMusic('ember_jig',{roomTune:true})` / `stopMusic({roomTune:
   true})` — a player-chosen track outranks the room and survives entering/leaving buildings).
   muteBtn still mutes. Desktop gets the tracks too.
8. **Mobile copy pass:** every "Close (Esc)" button says "Close" on touch; the Attacks how-to
   says "tap who to hit" (`#attackHowTo`, set in openAttackPanel).

**New testdrive probe:** `music()` → {choice, playing, trackId, roomTune, ctx}.
**Harness notes for next session:** offsetParent is ALWAYS null on position:fixed elements —
never use it for visibility checks (bit us twice; use computedStyle + rect). Building doors are
entered POSITIONALLY (roomAt() in the move loop) — teleport just inside the footprint + a tiny
joystick wiggle; the "pass through the door" hint is not a button that enters. Combat toasts
near spawn can be "hits for N!"/"fells for N!" from real night mobs — park test bots at
(220,220) for quiet. Scripts live in the ephemeral cloud `~/harness` (audit/verify/desktop-
smoke/app-smoke) — verify.cjs is the keeper: 69 assertions over every state above.

**Git queue for Michael:** `git add public/index.html public/client.js HANDOFF.md && git commit
&& git push` in town-chat (Render redeploys the web build); the app folders aren't a git repo —
their www/ copies are already current on disk. App Store/Play builds need the usual
`npx cap sync` + version bump when he next ships (BUILD docs unchanged).

*Last updated Sunday, July 12, 2026, ~11:15 AM EDT — end of Session J (mobile UX overhaul:
one-panel-at-a-time HUD, full-screen panels with ‹ Menu/back + bottom Close, hold-to-read
ability peeks, redesigned touch loadout, 4-track witchy music). If you add to the project,
append a short dated note here so the next session inherits it.*
